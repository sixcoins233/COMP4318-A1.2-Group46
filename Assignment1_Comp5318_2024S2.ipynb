    "In this assignment, you are tasked with the challenge of developing machine learning (ML) classifiers capable of categorizing grayscale images into predefined classes. Your task involves employing various classification algorithms to identify which is most effective and efficient in processing image data. Additionally, you are required to document your methodologies and findings in a detailed report. The total score for this assignment is allocated as follows:\n",

The validation set is not provided, but you can randomly pick a subset of the training set for validation. Your prediction over the test set must be submitted to Kaggle to receive the public accuracy over first 2,000 examples, you will use this accuracy to analyse the performance of your proposed method.
